# Isokoban

An isometric puzzle game based on Sokoban. Sokoban is a game in which the player tries to push all the boxes in a maze onto goal slots. Any box can be placed on any goal slot. The boxes are moved by pushing them one square at a time by the player character. The player cannot move through walls or boxes and can only push the boxes along the four cardinal directions, not diagonally. Also, boxes cannot go through walls or each other, and only one box can be pushed at a time. The objective is to place all boxes on the goal slots with a minimum number of pushes.
